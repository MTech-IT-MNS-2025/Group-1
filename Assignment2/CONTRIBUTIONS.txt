Task 1:Getting Started
-The code is in list.cpp
-Using OQS_KEM_alg_count(), OQS_KEM_alg_identifier(), OQS_SIG_alg_count(),the program(list.cpp) prints:
• The algorithm name
• Public key length
• Secret key length
• Ciphertext length (for KEMs)
• Signature length (for SIGs)

Task 2: Key Encapsulation (KEM)
- The code is in kem.cpp
- Implemented the Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) demo using the ML-KEM-512 algorithm.
  - Alice generates a key pair.
  - Bob uses Alice's public key to encapsulate a shared secret.
  - Alice decapsulates the ciphertext and recovers the same shared secret.
  - Both Alice’s and Bob’s shared secrets are displayed and compared for equality.
- Measured key generation time, encapsulation time, and decapsulation time, printing results to the console.

Task 3: Digital Signatures (SIG)
- The code is in sig.cpp
- Implemented the Digital Signature demo using the ML-DSA-44 signature algorithm.
  - Alice generates a key pair (public & secret keys).
  - Alice signs a message and Bob verifies the signature.
  - The program prints the signature and checks whether it is valid according to Bob.
- Measured and printed signature generation time.

Added README.md file
- Documented the steps to install dependencies, configure, build, and install liboqs and liboqs-cpp.
- Explained how to use liboqs-cpp in standalone applications, how to avoid namespace pollution.
- Provided installation instructions for Ubuntu and Fedora systems.
- Provided compilation and execution steps of the programs along with the screenshots.

-Conducted a comparative study between CLASSICAL and POST QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS.
-Measured and analyzed KEY_SIZES, SIGNATURE/CIPHERTEXT_SIZES, and EXECUTION_TIMES using cryptographic libraries.
-Identified trade-offs between PERFORMANCE, KEY_SIZES and QUANTUM RESISTANCE. 
-Concluded that ML-KEM is the most practical POQ algorithm for real-world deployment, with ML-DSA suitable for Digital Signatures.
-Highlighted the importance of hybrid cryptographic systems for a smooth transition quantum-secure environment.
-Documented observations results and analysis in a detailed report comparing SECURITY, PERFORMANCE, and IMPLEMENTATION.
-It is in COMPARISION folder.
