Task 2: Key Encapsulation (KEM)
- The code is in kem.cpp
- Implemented the Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) demo using the ML-KEM-512 algorithm.
  - Alice generates a key pair.
  - Bob uses Alice's public key to encapsulate a shared secret.
  - Alice decapsulates the ciphertext and recovers the same shared secret.
  - Both Alice’s and Bob’s shared secrets are displayed and compared for equality.
- Measured key generation time, encapsulation time, and decapsulation time, printing results to the console.

Task 3: Digital Signatures (SIG)
- The code is in sig.cpp
- Implemented the Digital Signature demo using the ML-DSA-44 signature algorithm.
  - Alice generates a key pair (public & secret keys).
  - Alice signs a message and Bob verifies the signature.
  - The program prints the signature and checks whether it is valid according to Bob.
- Measured and printed signature generation time.

Added README.md file
- Documented the steps to install dependencies, configure, build, and install liboqs and liboqs-cpp.
- Explained how to use liboqs-cpp in standalone applications, how to avoid namespace pollution.
- Provided installation instructions for Ubuntu and Fedora systems.
- Provided compilation and execution steps of the programs along with the screenshots.
