- I have contributed the entire `pages/` folder for this project.  
- This includes all frontend and backend page components such as `index.js`, `chat.js`, and the complete `api/` directory.  
- The `api/` directory contains the routes for user registration, message handling, and the `users/` subfolder.  
- These files together form the main structure for routing, API communication, and page rendering in the application.

----------
- Cloned the liboqs repository using the main branch.
- Configured the build environment with specific flags to disable OpenSSL, build static libraries only, and perform a minimal build focusing on a particular KEM algorithm (KEM_ml_kem_768).
- Used the emcmake wrapper to prepare the build environment, then compiled with ninja to generate the necessary libraries.
- Wrote a C code file (pqc.c) to interface with the liboqs library.
- Used emcc (Emscripten) to compile the C code along with the statically linked liboqs library.
- Applied various optimizations (-Oz) and configured the environment for WebAssembly (-s ENVIRONMENT=web), making the library available for web environments.
- Enabled memory growth and modularization, and exported specific functions (_malloc, _free, _pqc_keypair, _pqc_encaps, _pqc_decaps) for use in the generated WebAssembly module.
- Developed Keypair Generation Tool:
- Wrote gen_kem_768.c, a C program to generate an ML-KEM-768 keypair using the liboqs library.
- The program generates both the public and secret keys in raw binary format, which are saved to files (<username>_pk.raw, <username>_sk.raw).
- Included detailed instructions for compiling, running, and converting the raw key files to base64 encoded files for easier transmission and storage.

- Engineered a custom Node.js server integrated with Next.js and Socket.io, enabling real-time messaging, online/offline user tracking, and network-wide              accessibility for chat clients.
- Designed and implemented a MongoDB-backed message persistence system using Mongoose, supporting offline message delivery, timestamp-based sorting, and delivery     status tracking.
- Optimized server performance through modular socket event management and index-based MongoDB queries for efficient message retrieval.
- Configured CORS policies, environment variable management (.env.local), and dynamic IP detection for secure and flexible deployment across local and LAN networks.
- Automated offline message synchronization and delivery acknowledgment, ensuring message consistency even during user disconnects.
- Streamlined the server initialization and error handling process with clean async flow, ensuring reliability and maintainability in production environments.
- Managed backend environment setup, dependency control, and scripts through package.json to maintain consistent runtime configurations.
